# Data Scinece Portfolio

Hi, welcome to my Data Science portfolio! Here, I showcase various projects demonstrating my skills using Python, databases and ML. Hereby I'd like to demonstrate my skills in EDA, modeling predicative models etc. Each project highlights different techniques and solutions applied to real-world problems.


 ## Projects
1. **Titanic Survival Prediction**
Description: This project focuses on the famous Titanic dataset. I started by cleaning and preprocessing the data to handle missing values, categorical variables, and outliers. After preparing the dataset, I built a predictive model I built 5 different predictive models and based on the preformance I decided to choose the logistic regression model to determine which passengers were more likely to survive the disaster.

Techniques Used: Data cleaning, feature engineering, logistic regression, model evaluation (accuracy, precision, recall).

2. **Customer Purchase Prediction for Marketing Campaign**
Description: In this project, I analyzed customer behavior data and customer demographics to build a predictive model aimed at identifying which clients are more likely to buy the product in the second round of a marketing campaign. This project involved working with financial data, performing feature selection, and using classification algorithms to create the model. The part of the assgment was a budget that allowed us to contact the clients that we predicted could buy our product. We had to calculate if the campain was profitable. 
Techniques Used: Data preprocessing, using SQL, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, classification algorithms (e.g., decision trees, random forest), and model evaluation.

FUTURE PROJECTS
- Store Sales Analysis with the Time Series
